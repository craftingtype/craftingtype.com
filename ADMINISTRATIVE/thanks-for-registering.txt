Hi $name

We are thrilled to register you for Crafting Type. 

If you have any questions, please contact us by replying 
to this email.

We will confirm your payment in the next few days, as 
TUG processes orders by hand. You will receive a 
receipt in another email from the TUG Office. 



To prepare for the upcoming Crafting Type workshop, 
it helps to be familiar with the basics of font editing,
which you can learn at your own pace before the event.
We think of Crafting Type as a skill multiplier, so the
more experience you have when you arrive, the more you
can learn with us by your side.

So we'd like to invite you to install a font editor 
before you arrive. If you can't find the time, or need 
any help at all with this process, don't worry - just 
arrive half an hour earlier on the first day and we'll 
do our best to get you ready then. If there's a queue, 
we will make sure your editor is set up by the middle 
of the day.

But which one?

Actually you have lots of options!

What you choose may depend on your budget and what you 
expect to do after Crafting Type. Here are the 3 most 
common options, with other further below:



FontForge runs on Mac, Windows and GNU+Linux, and it is 
totally free of charge and will continue to work after 
the workshop forever at no cost. It is also libre 
software, so you are invited to join the FontForge 
community and contribute to its manual, send in crash 
reports, and propose new features. Its simple UI and 
comprehensive features makes it a good choice for 
beginners.

Fontlab Studio 5 runs on Mac and Windows, and 
FontLab Inc. is offering a free trial license for the 
workshop that lasts a few weeks afterwards too, 
and a 20% discount on the full license price of 
USD$649, so the price for Crafting Type participants 
is USD$519.20. FontLab Studio is widely used by 
professional type designers and foundries. It runs 
best on Windows and pre-Retina Macs. To get
the trial or discount code, email thomas@craftingtype.com

Thanks for reading all this. As a bonus for that, here's

moment with before the workshop, about how professional
