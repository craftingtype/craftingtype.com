			<h3>1 Day Only</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="span8 day-desc">
			<h3>Morning: Type Design Essentials</h3>

			<p>3 one hour sessions push students through pencil sketching
			skills, Latin script essentials, and digital drawing basics.</p>

 			<p>Our first session puts to work the special design process that
			is the beating heart of typeface design. We reveal how to avoid
			the fatal mistake that all beginners (and even some professionals)
			make when sketching letters.</p>

			<p>This ends with an intense lecture on the history of Latin
			letter forms, the effects of writing tools, and the balance of
			form and function. We will also demonstrate cutting edge research
			that shows how the script is based on a calligraphic
			<em>system</em>.</p>

			<p>After more sketching, we review digital drawing. A tour of the
			key features of a type application will reveal the surprising
			differences between Bezier drawing for illustration and type.
			Using these techniques you will create a functional OpenType font
			and take to lunch a full page of text set with your own
			design.</p>
			
			<p><em>Lunchtime Bonus Session: "Types of Desire"</em> While we
			eat lunch we will informally discuss typefaces that are desirable
			&mdash; or not.</p>

			<h3>Afternoon: Digital Type Design</h3>

			<p>After lunch we take our sketches forward into digital drawings,
			with detailed and personal feedback from our expert
			instructors.</p>

			<p>The learning curve with type is steep, and your talent is going
			to be tested on some of the toughest shapes in the Latin alphabet.
			Fortunately, we have an ace in the hole that will help smooth
			things out for anyone with anger management issues.</p>

			<p>The day ends with a critical review of the day's creations and
			an open question session where we will answer any question about
			typography that you can ask!</p>

			<h3>Day 2 Morning: Refining Your Skills</h3>

			<p>The workshop continues with the most valuable aspect of a live
			training event: 1-on-1 personal tutorial time packed full of
			assisted sketching and digital drawing.

			<h3>Day 2 Afternoon: Advanced Topics</h3>

			<p>The afternoon offers a range of advanced topics, such as:</p>

			<h4>Family Planning</h4>

			<p>Type families that offer a broad palette of choices are
			required for both intricate text typography and maximum graphic
			impact. To grow your single font into a family, you will see how
			to adjust it into both bold and light weights.</p>

			<p>The Latin writing system has 4 sets of letters, Roman upper and
			lowercase and Italic upper and lowercase. You will learn how font
			technology handles the special nature of italics plus drawing
			techniques to get creative with cursive forms.</p>

			<h4>OpenType Features</h4>
			
			<p>A strange question comes up when non-designers hear that
			<em>drawing letters</em> is a profession: "How can you draw
			something new? Haven&rsquo;t they all been thought of already?"
			What makes this so strange is that when you&rsquo;re sketching and
			get really &ldquo;in the zone,&rdquo; you generate <em>too
			many</em> ideas. Today you can deliver them all to your users with
			the power of OpenType. We will show you how to go beyond providing
			stylistic alternatives to give your type mutant powers.</p>

			<h4>Cyrillic Script</h4>
			
			 <p>We will enlighten you about modern Cyrillic and it's
			continuing importance.</p>

			<h4>Earning Money</h4>

			<p>Finally we will wrap up the day with a discussion about how you
			can earn money with your new skills.</p>

			<h3>Evening: Party!</h3>
			<p>Come relax with us after long &amp; fulfilling days of learning! Details &amp; location for participants.</p>
