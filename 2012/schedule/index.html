			<h3>1 Day</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="span8 day-desc">
			<h3>Morning: The Essence of Latin Typeface Design</h3>

			<p>3 one hour sessions push students through pencil sketching
            skills, Latin script essentials, and digital drawing basics.</p>

 			<p>Our first session puts to work the special design process that
            is the beating heart of typeface design. We reveal how to avoid
            the fatal mistake that all beginners (and even some professionals)
            make when sketching letters.</p>

			<p>This ends with an intense lecture on the history of Latin
            letter forms, the effects of writing tools, and the balance of
            form and function. We will also demonstrate cutting edge research
            that shows how the script is based on a calligraphic
            <em>system</em>.</p>

			<p>After more sketching, we turn to digital drawing of key
			Latin letters and go to lunch with printed samples of our work!</p>
			
			<p><em>Lunchtime Bonus Session: "Types of Desire"</em>
			While we eat lunch we will informally discuss typefaces that
			are desirable &mdash; or not.</p>

			<h3>Afternoon: Type Design Tutorial</h3>

			<p>After lunch we continue sketching and drawing with detailed
			and personal feedback from our expert instructors.</p>

			<p>We end the day with a critical review of the day's creations
			and an open question session where we will answer any question 
			about typography that you can ask!</p>

			<h3>Day 2</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="span8 day-desc">
			<h3>Morning: From Sketch to Screen</h3>
			<p>After a tour of the key features of a type application, you&rsquo;ll learn the surprising differences between Bezier drawing for illustration and type. Using these techniques you will create a functional OpenType font and take to lunch a full page of text set with your own design.</p>

			<h3>Afternoon: Dangerous Curves</h3>
			<p>This session could well end badly. The learning curve with type is steep, and your talent is going to be tested on some of the toughest shapes in the Latin alphabet. Fortunately, we have an ace in the hole that will help smooth things out for anyone with anger management issues.</p>

			<h3>Evening: Sketching and Drawing Tutorial Time</h3>
			<p>With the highs and lows of today's workshops, this evening&rsquo;s session is a calm period to unwind in. You are invited to refine your work while the instructors are on hand to tutor you 1-on-1.</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle">Super Powers</h2>
			<h3>Day 3</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="span8 day-desc">
<h3>Morning: Mutant Powers for Designers</h3>
<p>Type designers are continually faced with choices. <em>&ldquo;How high is too high?&rdquo;</em> Echoing the collaboration method from Day 1, you&rsquo;ll learn how to harness the dumb power of computers to mutate your design and evolve it to a higher level.</p>

<h3>Afternoon: Mutant Powers for Users</h3>
<p>A strange question comes up when non-designers hear that <em>drawing letters</em> is a profession: "How can you draw something new? Haven&rsquo;t they all been thought of already?" What makes this so strange is that when you&rsquo;re sketching and get really &ldquo;in the zone,&rdquo; you generate <em>too many</em> ideas. Today you can deliver them all to your users with the power of OpenType. In this session you will go beyond providing stylistic alternatives to give your type mutant powers.</p>

<h3>Evening: World Domination</h3>
<p>The Latin writing system is used on every continent, from Alberta to Vietnam. In this workshop you will take your typeface beyond English with accents and additional letters needed for other languages.</p>

			<h2 class="subtitle">Family Time</h2>
			<h3>Day 4</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="span8 day-desc">
<h3>Morning: Weights</h3>
<p>Type families that offer a broad palette of choices are required for both intricate text typography and maximum graphic impact. To grow your single font into a family, you will learn how to adjust it into both bold and light weights.</p>

<h3>Afternoon: Italics</h3>
<p>The Latin writing system has 4 sets of letters, Roman upper and lowercase and Italic upper and lowercase. You will learn how font technology handles the special nature of italics plus drawing techniques to get creative with cursive forms.</p>

<h3>Evening: Sketching and Drawing Tutorial Time</h3>
<p>You are again invited return to the studio after dinner and spend the evening working alongside our instructors.</p>

			<h3>Day 5</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="span8 day-desc">
<h3>Morning: The Joy of Print</h3>
<p>Kerning is a fine detail, and there are heaps of other ultra&ndash;subtle optical adjustments that are crucial to understand when perfecting your typeface for use in print. You&rsquo;ll walk through all these as you continue to refine your work.</p>

<h3>Afternoon: Web Fonts</h3>
<p>Web browsers today don&rsquo;t even support kerning, and the coarse grain of the screen has its own tricks and traps. You&rsquo;ll learn how to apply hinting to your fonts so they look their best on legacy systems, and what to consider when designing type for the web.</p>

<p>Finally we will wrap up the week with a lecture on how you can earn money with your new skills.</p>

<h3>Evening: Party!</h3>
<p>Come relax with us after a long &amp; fulfilling week of learning! Details &amp; location TBA.</p>
